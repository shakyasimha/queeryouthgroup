# Documentation for the Queer Youth Group Website

The `docs/` folder was created in this repository with the sole purpose of documenting the functioning of the website. 
This is to make sure that revisiting the website in maintenance or overhauling wouldn't result in tediously spending hours trying to understand what is going on under the hood, which makes the development work much more difficult.

- `styling-guide.md` -> contains the guide for colorschemes and fonts used in the website.
- `react-components.md` -> contains a detailed documentation on what each of the React components used in this website does.
- `sanity-setup.md` -> Documentation on how Sanity was setup and how to use the Sanity CMS in this website.
- `onedrive-setup.md` -> Documentation on how Onedrive was setup for fetching the organization's publications stored on OneDrive to the website.

Separate documentation files have been maintained to document each and every working aspect of the website. I hope you maintain the decorum by documenting this project well.
